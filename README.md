# so_long
This project is to create a small 2D game with C.  
Using [minilinX](https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux) to put image to window.
It only works on Linux 

## game rule
- The player is a slime.
- The goal is to escape the stage with fewer steps.

The map must be composed of only 5 possible characters:  
- 0 for an empty space 
- 1 for a wall
- C for a collectible

This is an example.
